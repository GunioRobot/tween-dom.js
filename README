If you're a ActionScript developer too, probably you're missing tweening engines like Twenner and TweenMax for JavaScript. Fortunately, there're an excelent tweening engine in JavaScript called Tween.js. But, again, if you came from an ActionScript background, the use of Tween.js isn't so friendly.

So, that's what Dom-Tween.js is for. It adapts the Tween.js to set tweening values in DOM style properties directly and adds some more features.
